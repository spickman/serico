This is my first post and a few things have had to happen to get this far. 

- I have decided that I want to <strong>improve my programming ability</strong>. Not the way I have been doing it up to now, but actual projects that will be pushed to Github in all their glory.

- Whatever I end up doing I want the ability to <strong>write clean, efficient code</strong> that solves more problems than it creates without my overreliance on other peoples snippets.

- I've started my first true project <strong>"SixSigma Toolbox"</strong> in C#.


A little about me:
I really enjoy building computers, for myself, for family, for friends... 
In honor of the computer that saw me through 4 years at university.

<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col two" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/DesktopV1.jpg">
    <div class="col one">
        Specs:<br/>
        - Closed loop cooling CPU/GPU<br/>
        - Intel i7 Broadwell<br/>
        - 32 Gig 1866Mhz DDR3 Ram<br/>
        - 120 Gig Corsair SSD<br/>
        - 2*1Tb Raid 1<br/>
        - ATI HD7550 GPU<br/>
        <br>
        A bit of a tight fit, and airflow isn't the best, but it succesfully got me into hte realm of Machine learning and my Master project "The Perfect Clustering Algorithm". Specs are a little light as I haven't got it plugged in tto check.

And my current main computer:
<br>

<div class="img_row">
    <div class="col one">
    Specs:<br/>
        - Corsair 760T Case
        - Custom loop watercooling<br/>
        - 380mm Top / 240mm Front <br/>
        - 8 Coraisr MagLev fans<br/>
        - 16gig DDR3 3200Mhz Ram<br/>
        - 240gig NVMe SSD<br/>
        - 2*1Tb Raid 1<br/>
        - GTX 1070<br/>
        - Intel i7 Skylake<br/>
        - Can't forget the LEDS!!<br/>
    </div>
    <img class="col two" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/DesktopV2.jpg">
</div>

The watercooling was fun (but stressful) to do and there were definitely a couple of "grab the towels" moments. In a few of months I may consider changing the colour scheme to a dark red; one of the bonus of only buying white LEDS.

On top of this I have an old Alienware laptop with Ubuntu installed, on which I am currently typing this post! 

Future posts will detail my programming adventures. If I find useful bits of information, or things that I have struggled to piece together, I'll attempt to add to the great knowledge of the internet and consolodate them in a post.
