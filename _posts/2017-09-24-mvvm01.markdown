This series of posts will focus on implementing the MVVM (Model View ViewModel) strcuture in a C# WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) application. 

WPF has added many useful things that help achieve the necesary isolation between the MVVM pattern components.

        <strong>What is MVVM?</strong><br><br>
        MVVM is made up of 3 parts. <br>
        Model | View | ViewModel<br><br>

   I'm not going to go into an explaination of the pattern itself as <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/hh848246.aspx">MSDN</a> has a very good article explaining the components. <br/><br>
        <a href="http://reedcopsey.com/2010/01/06/better-user-and-developer-experiences-from-windows-forms-to-wpf-with-mvvm-part-7-mvvm/">Reed Copsey</a> has a very good summary of the beneifts of MVVM, including a discussion of WPF vs Windows Forms. 
He also has an example application that follows his blog on the development of the MVVM pattern, but I feel it falls short when you try and implement more interesting cases.

There are a host of other websites that give introduction into MVVM with WPF to varying degrees. I am going to focus on the issues I had after reading these introductions as I tried to actually create an application.

Assuming that you've read around the topic and think MVVM is the way to go, lets have a look at how we actually implement this in the code. 

I will cover the issues below in following posts:
<div style="margin-left:20px; line-height:200%;">
1) A base viewmodel class<br>
2) Viewmodel structure<br>
3) Conditonal Bindings <br>
4) Having multiple pages in the application<br>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
4a) Using viewmodels within viewmodels<br>
4b) Referencing a command in a parent viewmodel<br>
</div>
5) Getting a textbox to update when enter (or any key) is hit. <br>
6) A splash screen that shows for a minimum set time <br>
</div>
