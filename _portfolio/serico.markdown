I have always wanted to have my own website and after graduation, and my new interest in software development, I wanted a place to showcase my projects. 

This website is origonally based off the 'folio' theme and built using Jekyll hosted on Github. 

My aims are: 
- to keep this updated with my current progress
- post things that I have found usefull or had to search long and hard for
- use this as motivation to keep on coding and developing myself

<strong>To progress!</strong>
